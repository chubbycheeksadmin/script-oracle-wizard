# Production Feasibility Engine - Claude Context

## Project Overview
A feasibility assessment tool for advertising production, helping agency producers evaluate scripts, budgets, and schedules.

## Key Knowledge Base
See `/src/knowledge/production-knowledge-base.md` for comprehensive production knowledge including:
- UK/EU cost bands per shoot day
- MOCO constraints and alternatives
- High-speed camera limitations
- 2nd unit considerations
- Schedule calculations

## Quick Reference - Costs

### UK Production Per Day
- Lean: £180,000
- Standard: £215,000
- Ambitious: £250,000

### EU Service Company Per Day (+ UK above-the-line)
- Lean: £85,000
- Standard: £110,000
- Ambitious: £140,000

## Quick Reference - Schedule

### Setups Per Day
- Standard: 10
- MOCO: 4 max
- Studio: 12-15

### Key Rules
1. Don't assume 2nd unit works - flag as "possible" not baseline
2. MOCO = 4 setups/day max on location
3. High-speed camera needs daylight - won't work for night scenes
4. Same house (multiple rooms) = 1 location, not multiple
5. DRTV versions share setups - count unique, not total
6. Estimate realistic planning number (3 days), not optimized (2 days)

## MOCO vs Static for Low-Light Scenes
- **MOCO**: Dynamic camera, "1st person - riding with the element"
- **Static plates + CG**: Observational, "3rd person - watching the element"
- Same VFX complexity, different creative feel
- MOCO needs specialist equipment (hard for remote locations)

## Hybrid Approach for Mixed Lighting
- **Daylight scenes**: High-speed + practical element on wire
- **Night scenes**: MOCO (if budget allows) or static plates + CG

## Shot Timing for Commercials
- Average shot: 2 seconds
- End frame: 3-4 seconds
- 30" = ~13 shots + end frame
- 20" = ~8 shots + end frame
