## UK Production Costs (APA)

### Cost Per Shoot Day
| Scale | Per Day | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Lean | £180,000 | Simple shoot, minimal locations, small crew |
| Standard | £215,000 | Standard commercial, some complexity |
| Ambitious | £250,000 | Multiple locations, 2nd unit, complex setups |

**Reference:** Gousto "The Heist" - 2 days with 2nd unit, swing crews, techno crane = £474,928 (~£237k/day ambitious)

## Schedule Constants

### Setups Per Day
| Scenario | Setups/Day |
|----------|------------|
| Standard UK commercial | 10 |
| With experienced crew | 10-12 |
| Technical/hero heavy | 8 |
| MOCO shoot | 4 maximum |
| Studio shoot | 12-15 |

### Time Allowances
- Average setup: 45 mins
- Company move: 60 mins travel + 45 mins reset = 105 mins total
- Turnover (call to camera): 90 mins
- Lunch: 60 mins mandatory
- Technical/hero setup: 75 mins minimum

### Company Moves
- 2 moves/day = comfortable
- 3 moves/day = achievable if locations close
- Same practical location, different areas = NOT a company move

---

## 2nd Unit Considerations

### When 2nd Unit Helps
- Food/recipe shots (cooking, plating, ingredients)
- Product inserts (pack shots, app demos)
- Can run in parallel IF location permits two crews

### Critical Rule
**Never assume 2nd unit will work in baseline estimates.**
- 2nd unit requires location that allows simultaneous crews
- Flag as "possible optimization" not baseline assumption
- User must confirm location suitability

### Impact
- ~10 setups handled by 2nd unit = ~1 day saved
- 5+ setups = ~0.5 day saved

---

## MOCO (Motion Control)

### When MOCO is Required
- Flying objects needing precise, repeatable trajectories
- Complex camera moves requiring multiple identical passes
- VFX-heavy tracking shots
- Product in motion (bottles, caps, etc.)

### MOCO Constraints
| Factor | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Setups per day | 4 maximum |
| Time per setup | 45-90 mins (programming + 3-4 passes) |
| Repositioning rig | 30-45 mins |
| Golden hour capacity | 2 setups maximum |
| Equipment transport | Difficult for remote/island locations |

### MOCO in Studio vs Location
- **Studio:** Efficient, 6-8 setups/day, robot pre-programmed overnight
- **Location:** Slow, 4 setups/day max, add 50% to schedule

### MOCO Passes Required
1. Clean plate
2. Talent pass
3. Element pass (cap/product)
4. Safety pass

---

## High-Speed Camera

### Light Requirements
- 500-1000fps requires 4-8x more light than normal
- Only viable for daylight/well-lit scenes
- **Cannot work for night/dusk scenes** without destroying atmosphere

### When to Use
- Daylight product moments (bottle opening, cap pop)
- Practical elements on wire (cap, liquid)
- Where organic movement matters

### High-Speed + Night = Problem
Night scenes requiring high-speed would need stadium-level lighting.
This destroys mood. Solution: CG element or MOCO instead.

---

## Hybrid Approach: High-Speed + MOCO/Static

### Day 1 - Daylight Scenes
**High-speed camera + practical element on wire**
- Enough light for high-speed (500-1000fps)
- Practical = organic, real movement
- Rig removal in post (simpler than full CG)
- Dynamic camera possible

### Day 2 - Low Light Scenes
**Option A: MOCO (if budget/logistics allow)**
- Normal camera speed = normal light OK
- Dynamic camera moves (1st person, "riding with" the element)
- CG element composited onto passes
- Premium feel

**Option B: Static plates (if MOCO not possible)**
- Standard kit, no specialist equipment
- Faster shoot (8-10 setups vs 4)
- Observational feel (3rd person, "watching" the element)
- Small movement can be added in post
- Same VFX complexity as MOCO

### Creative Difference
| Approach | Camera | Audience POV | Feel |
|----------|--------|--------------|------|
| MOCO | Dynamic, follows element | "We ARE the element" | Energetic, immersive |
| Static | Observational | "We WATCH the element" | Elegant, composed |

Both work - it's a creative choice, not quality issue.

## Shot Planning for Commercials

### Timing Rules
- Average shot: 2 seconds
- End frame: 3-4 seconds
- 30" spot: ~13 shots + end frame
- 20" spot: ~8 shots + end frame

### Short Films from Hero
When shooting hero film + cutdown shorts:
- Shorts are lifted from hero footage
- Only additional shots needed: alternate end frames
- Maybe 1-2 pickup shots per short for standalone opening

---

## Product Moments (Drinks/Bottles)

### Critical Hero Shots (Schedule Extra Time)
1. **Bottle opening / cap pop** - 45-60 mins
2. **Bubbles in final sip (ECU)** - 60-90 mins
3. **End frame beauty shot** - 60-90 mins

### Bubbles Technical Requirements
- Fresh pour for each take (bubbles die after 2-3 mins)
- Macro lens (100mm minimum)
- Backlight or sidelight to catch refraction
- Test glasses for how they show carbonation
- Cold liquid holds carbonation better
- Dedicated home economist pouring fresh

---

## Studio vs Location Shoots

### Studio Shoot Indicators
- Multiple stylized "rooms" (kitchen, living room, etc.)
- All INT scenes with no specific real locations
- Branded/themed sets that need building
- Product-heavy with hero moments each scene

### Studio Efficiency
- 12-15 setups/day achievable
- Company moves = 0 (set changes only, 30-45 mins)
- MOCO efficient (pre-programmed)
- Parallel work possible (photo unit, prep next set)

---

## Children on Set (UK Regulations)

| Age | Max Hours on Set | Max Performance Hours |
|-----|------------------|----------------------|
| Under 5 | 5 hours | 2 hours |
| 5-8 | 8 hours | 3 hours |
| 9+ | 9.5 hours | 5 hours |

---

## Post-Production Floors

| Type | Minimum |
|------|---------|
| Standard (online + grade + sound + music + deliverables) | £80,000 |
| VFX-heavy | £120,000 - £180,000 |

---

## Key Rules of Thumb

1. **Don't assume 2nd unit** - flag as possible, not baseline
2. **MOCO = 4 setups/day max** on location
3. **High-speed needs daylight** - can't fake night with big lights
4. **Static plates + CG = easier VFX** than tracking moving camera
5. **House (kitchen, bedroom, living room) = 1 location** not 3
6. **DRTV versions share setups** - count unique, not total versions
7. **UK crews do 10 setups/day** realistically (12 with perfect conditions)
8. **3 days baseline, 2 if optimized** - estimate realistic, not best-case

---

## Reference Projects

### Gousto "The Heist"
- 2 days actual (2nd unit, swing crews)
- 3 days baseline (without assuming 2nd unit works)
- House + Supermarket = 2 real locations
- £474,928 total
- ~£237k/day (ambitious)

### Homesense (4 stylized rooms)
- 2 days studio
- MOCO, magic elements
- Sets built side by side
- Higher efficiency (12-15 setups/day)

### Three Cents "Flying Bottle Cap"
- Flying element through day + night scenes
- Day 1: High-speed practical (daylight)
- Day 2: MOCO or static (night) - budget dependent
- MOCO = dynamic, static = observational
- Both deliver the story differently
